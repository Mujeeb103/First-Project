    <h1>Things about me</h1>
     <h2>Paragraph About Myself</h2>
   <p> My name is Mujeeb. I am 18 years old and I live in Surrey British Columbia.
      My favourite colour is blue. My favourite hobby is playing video games. I 
    like watching shows and movies on netflix as well. I have two pet bunnies named
cloudy and chestnut. I recently graduated from highschool and currently attend BCIT.
My alarm is always ringing at 8:30 am. If i don't wake up, my dad usually sais "get 
out of bed <em>now."</em> On my second day of class I got up late, so I had to <strong>quickly</strong>
get out of bed. </p>
